							<h1>Treatment </h1>
							<h3>1.Neck pain and headaches</h3>
							<p>
								Headaches can be caused by multiple issues and may be direct or referred in nature. Direct headaches will have their origin within your head and may relate to stress, chemical changes within your brain, food reactions, or other causes. Headaches can often be referred from your cervical spine (neck), your mid to upper back and your jaw. Referred headaches can often relate to poor posture, or inadequate flexibility or stability around the neck.
							</p>
							<p>Regardless of the potential issues at play, we specialize in thorough analysis and assessment. Our clinicians identify issues and develop treatment programs to deliver effective outcomes.</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions : </b></p>
							
							<p>
								The head and neck are complex interrelated structures comprising intricate networks of discs, ligaments, vessels and vertebrae. As a result, there can be multiple factors contributing to head or neck pain. Some of the more common conditions we treat include post-surgical rehabilitation, disc problems, stiffness, facet joint dysfunction, neck related headaches, postural problems, acute sprains and strains, osteoarthritis and arm pain referring from the neck.
							</p>
							<h3>2.Shoulder</h3>
							
							<p>
								Like every patient we see, we treat every shoulder issue on a case by case basis. We tailor our approach to meet your specific individual needs. We’ll obtain a full overview to determine the issue: the location and type of pain, the mechanism of injury, any aggravating factors, easing factors, contributing lifestyle factors, and your personal goals for rehabilitation. Then, we get to work.
							</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions : </b></p>
							<p>
								Shoulder pain can be linked to a range of injuries, and resolution may require treatment to your shoulder, back and neck. Some of the more frequent conditions that present in clinic are postural dysfunctions or problems, post-surgical rehabilitation, tendon impingement, shoulder bursitis, acute joint soft tissue injuries, rotator cuff dysfunction, rotator cuff tears, AC joint injuries, and post-fracture rehabilitation.
							</p>
							<h3>3.Elbow, wrist and hand</h3>

							<p>
								  Pain, tingling or numbness around the elbow, wrist or hand can often be a sign of an overuse injury. These symptoms can be caused by a range of issues, but they’re commonly associated with overloading tendons, muscles, and sometimes neural structures.
							</p>
							<p>Overloading can occur in sports and through biomechanical issues, but it frequently presents as an issue for office workers. Repetitive actions – performed day in, day out – can have an accumulative, damaging effect over the long term. Whether it’s tennis-elbow, carpal tunnel or a trigger finger problem, pain and discomfort will impact upon your performance: both in sport and at the workplace.</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions : </b></p>
							<p>There are many conditions that can affect the elbow, forearm and hand. Some of the more common issues we treat in clinic include tennis elbow, golfer’s elbow, post-surgical rehabilitation, post-fracture rehabilitation, bursitis, post-dislocation rehabilitation, acute sprains and strains, postural problems, tendonitis, repetitive strain injuries, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.</p>
							<h3>4.Back </h3>
							<p>Back pain can affect anyone and everyone. Regardless of your age, or whether you’re an athlete or an office worker – or both – the back is a complex, nerve rich structure that is susceptible to a wide variety of issues.</p>
							<p>We provide a range of treatments to manage your back pain, including manipulation, mobilization, massage, stretching, dry-needling  and taping/strapping.  The essence of our clinic is to provide long term solutions, so postural  reeducation and specific rehabilitation exercises form an important component of our treatment.
							</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions: </b></p>
							<p><b>Posture</b> : When we adopt certain postures over prolonged periods of time, the joints and tissues (muscles and ligaments) adapt into these postures by shortening and tightening, or lengthening and weakening. The way we sit or stand affects our joint position and our muscle length and strength. </p>
							<p><b>Postural pain and dysfunction</b>: Prolonged or poor sitting can fatigue muscles, putting extra pressure on the joints, discs and nerves.  Over-correcting a slouched posture will also cause pain by overworking the extensor muscles, compressing down on the joints and nerves in the spine and decreasing the abdominal muscle activity.</p>
							<p><b>Disc problems</b>: Repetitive movements such as bending, or a sudden onset injury involving bending and twisting, can cause weakness or disruption of the fibrous ring on the outer surface of a disc. This allows the contents of the disc to push out of their natural location.Prolonged sitting such as office work and poor posture also puts strain on the back of the outer ring of the disc as the spine is held in a flexed and stretched position.</p>
							<p><b>Nerve root pain</b>: This is often referred to as ‘pinched nerve’ or ‘sciatica’.  True sciatica is compression of the sciatic nerve causing pain along the sciatic nerve into the leg.  Compression can occur due to a disc bulge pressing on the nerve, or tight gluteal (buttock) muscles restricting the natural stretch of the sciatic nerve. Other nerves, apart from Sciatic, can also be affected. Each nerve root will tend to refer pain to a particular location. Sciatic will most commonly refer pain down the back of the leg to the outside of the calf and sometimes sole of the foot. Pinching of a root leading to the femoral nerve, however, will most likely refer pain into the groin or the front of the thigh.</p>
							<p>Trigger points or attenuated ligaments and tendons in the trunk can also refer pain into the buttocks or lower limbs.  Referred pain can be described as throbbing, aching, or burning, pins and needles, or numbness.</p>
							<p><b>Spondylolisthesis</b>: This is a term used when one vertebra has slipped out of place on the vertebra below. The slipping reduces the space in the spinal canal and narrows the hole where the nerve exits leading to stenosis. This can compress the nerve roots and cause referred pain, pins and needles, or numbness. The most common cause of the condition is general wear and tear leading to ligament lengthening and weakening , although it can also be caused by traumatic fractures or stress fractures.</p>
							<h3>5.Hip and groin </h3>
							<p>Hip, groin and back pain can be closely related. It takes a thorough and highly skilled approach to identify the specific source of pain, alleviate the issue, and prevent it from recurring.</p>
							<p>That’s why our initial consultation is an extended one-hour appointment – to ensure that our experienced doctors have the time required to systematically assess issues and develop detailed, personal treatment plans for hip and groin pain.</p>
							<p>Through careful analysis and assessment, we can identify your issue and any associated knock-on effects, relieve your pain, minimize your chance of recurrence and get you back to work, sport and your normal routine. That’s the treat, cure, prevent approach in action.</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions :</b></p>
							<p>We commonly treat a range of issues, including postural dysfunctions, post-surgical rehabilitation, post fracture rehabilitation, acute strains, labral or cartilage tears, muscle tears or muscular movement dysfunctions, and back pain referring into or related to the hip or groin.</p>
							<h3>6.Knee</h3>
							<p>Knee pain is a common and unwelcome symptom. It can present either through a direct injury, such as twisting of the joint while playing sport, or more gradually over time due to poor movement patterns, repeated loading, or congenital conditions.Our approach to treating knee pain is equally as broad. We tailor your individual treatment plan to suit your lifestyle and objectives. </p>
							<p><b>Common conditions: </b></p>
							<p>Post-surgical rehabilitation for ACL, patello-femoral syndrome, ITB syndrome, tendinopathies, acute ligament sprains and muscle strains, and meniscus injuries, and post fracture rehabilitation.  We are also highly skilled at treating conditions that present with symptoms in the knee, but are related to the biomechanics of the foot and ankle, or hip, pelvis and trunk.</p>
							<h3>7.Foot and ankle</h3>
							<p>Whether your lifestyle is sporty or more subdued, foot pain is always unwelcome. We are perfectly equipped to identify and eliminate a range of foot and ankle injuries, to get you back in step with your regular routine. We can offer expert insight into a huge range of foot and ankle conditions, including those caused by acute injury, overuse, or ongoing biomechanical factors.</p>
							<p><b>Common conditions :</b></p>
							<p>There are many issues that can affect the feet and ankles. Some of the more common issues we treat in clinic include Achilles tendon pain, plantar fasciitis, post-surgical rehabilitation, acute sprains and strains, tendinopathy, and calf tightness. </p>
